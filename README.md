# The-Analytics-Edge
The Analytics Edge course from edX-MIT.
The Analytics Edge course is taught in programming language R and participants work on assignments in R. I am also participant of this course and decided to complete assignments
in python. So these jupyter notebooks are python version of each weeks assignment. Since python and R are not exactly same, some of the concept/code from assignments are not fully coded
in these notebooks (eg step functions in R) .
